These are just plain simple Makefile rules you can add to your own Makefiles for some personality ;)
Please be aware that the sounds in the includes folder are being played through afplay, meaning that as it is they only work on Mac. If you want to make them work on your own OS please figure out what tool(s) you need to play .mp3 files in your terminal and replace "@afplay" in this makefile with whatever works for you.
Although these are fairly useless and I would strongly advise against using them in any serious work, it's always fun to have a little easter egg somewhere.
Have fun ;)

Current Makefile includes:

	Loading bar animation;

	Cleaning animation;

	Parrot.live;

	Pickle Rick;

	Lightning McQueen (says KACHOW ⚡️);

	GitHub (plays a sound most of us are familiar with);
